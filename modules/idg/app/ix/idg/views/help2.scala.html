                The goal of the IDG KMC is to integrate a variety of data sources to shed light on unstudied and understudied
                targets. To achieve this we have pulled together data on protein targets, small molecule activity, genomic
                behavior and disease links. For a list of datasources, and their associated entity counts,
                see the <a href="@ix.idg.controllers.routes.IDGApp.about()">About Pharos</a> page. A visual representation
                of all targets and their representation in all IDG datasources can be viewed <a href="">here</a>. Over
                time we anticipate incorporating other relevant data sources.

                <a name="harmonogram"></a> <h2>Harmonogram</h2>
                The Harmonogram visualizes gene appearance in the <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome">Harmonizome</a>
                resources using interactive clustergrams. Genes are shown as rows and resources are shown as columns.
                The gene occurrence value is normalized relative to the occurrence of other genes in the resource - the
                darker the tile the more the gene occurs in the resource. The NIH Reporter Grants Linked to NCBI Genes
                column shows the number of grants linked to each gene and this column is highlighted in blue. The resources
                are classified into Resource Groups, e.g., Disease or Phenotype Associations, and they are color coded using the
                column triangles.
                <p>
                You can view clustergrams for different gene classes, e.g., kinases, using the buttons on the sidebar.
                    The ordering of the clustergram can be changed by clicking the reordering buttons or by double-clicking
                    the row or column labels. For instance, double-clicking the NIH Reporter Grants column in Kinases view
                    and zooming into the top of the clustergram reveals that EGFR is the kinase associated with the most grants.

                        <p>
                        The function which computes consensus expression level aggregates expression values from
                            GTEx, HPM and HPA into 11 tissue types (e.g., Digestive Tract, Endocrine System, etc.).
                            A consensus expression value for a given target is simply the mode (most frequent) of
                            the qualitative expression values in the aggregated set. The confidence value associated
                            with a consensus expression value is derived taking into consideration both the number and
                            consistency of supporting data. Confidence for Low and Medium levels should be interpreted
                            to mean confidence for that level of expression or higher.

                        These radial plots summarize the level of accumulated knowledge about each target.
                            The further the point is away from the center of the radial plot, the more knowledge exists
                            about the target. By mouse hovering the labels, the list of associated resources with links
                            are presented on the left. To compare the relative knowledge for the target to knowledge for
                            the target family, select to "overlay another dataset". The normalized knowledge for the target
                            family will show in orange.

                                GO terms, phenotypes, diseases, drugs, tissues, proteins, etc., depending on the
                                dataset. Some datasets require a few preprocessing steps to get here.</li>

                            <li>Normalize the counts by Calculate the empirical cumulative probability of

                            A ring chart, also known as a sunburst chart or a multilevel pie chart, is used to visualize
                            hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles. The circle in the centre
                            represents the root node, with the hierarchy moving outward from the center. A segment of the
                            inner circle bears a hierarchical relationship to those segments of the outer circle which
                            lie within the angular sweep of the parent segment.Also see this <a href="http://www.neoformix.com/2006/MultiLevelPieChart.html">
