                The goal of the IDG KMC is to integrate a variety of data sources to shed light on unstudied and understudied
                targets. To achieve this we have pulled together data on protein targets, small molecule activity, genomic
                behavior and disease links. For a list of datasources, and their associated entity counts,
                see the <a href="@ix.idg.controllers.routes.IDGApp.about()">About Pharos</a> page. A visual representation
                of all targets and their representation in all IDG datasources can be viewed here. Over
                time we anticipate incorporating other relevant data sources.

                <a name="harmonogram"></a> <h2>Harmonogram</h2>
                The Harmonogram visualizes gene appearance in the <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome">Harmonizome</a>
                resources using interactive clustergrams. Genes are shown as rows and resources are shown as columns.
                The gene occurrence value is normalized relative to the occurrence of other genes in the resource - the
                darker the tile the more the gene occurs in the resource. The NIH Reporter Grants Linked to NCBI Genes
                column shows the number of grants linked to each gene and this column is highlighted in blue. The resources
                are classified into Resource Groups, e.g., Disease or Phenotype Associations, and they are color coded using the
                column triangles.
                <p>
                You can view clustergrams for different gene classes, e.g., kinases, using the buttons on the sidebar.
                    The ordering of the clustergram can be changed by clicking the reordering buttons or by double-clicking
                    the row or column labels. For instance, double-clicking the NIH Reporter Grants column in Kinases view
                    and zooming into the top of the clustergram reveals that EGFR is the kinase associated with the most grants.
